CORSRangeHTTPServer is a lightweight Python3 module that extends SimpleHTTPServer
to support some HTTP Range requests, and allows CORS on all requests.

Note that this does not support the full specifications of range requests (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-2.3). 
* There is no support for multiple ranges and/or multipart payload
* Only Bytes ranges
* No if-range support
